# Accessibility & Color Contrast Fixes - October 17, 2025

## üéØ Issues Identified via Playwright Scan

### Original Problems Found:
1. **‚ùå Red buttons** - White text on #EF4444 red had contrast ratio of **3.76:1** (needed 4.5:1)
2. **‚ùå White-on-white text** - Text with `text-white` class showing contrast ratio of **1.0:1** (completely invisible)
3. **‚ùå Red numbered circles** - Numbers 1, 2, 3 had white text on light backgrounds
4. **‚ùå Red banner text** - "Received a Foreclosure Notice?" banner had visibility issues
5. **‚ùå Footer text** - Some footer links had poor contrast

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Primary Red Color
**Changed from**: `#EF4444` (contrast: 3.76:1 ‚ùå)
**Changed to**: `#DC2626` (contrast: 4.53:1 ‚úÖ)

This darker red provides WCAG AA compliant contrast with white text.

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/globals.css` - Updated `.btn-primary` background color

### 2. Fixed Tailwind v4 Color System
Tailwind CSS v4 doesn't automatically load colors from `tailwind.config.js`. Had to manually define color utilities in CSS.

**Added to `/app/globals.css`**:
```css
.bg-primary { background-color: #DC2626; }
.text-primary { color: #DC2626; }
.border-primary { border-color: #DC2626; }
.hover\:bg-primary:hover { background-color: #DC2626; }
.text-secondary { color: #1F2937; }
.text-white { color: #ffffff; }
```

### 3. Fixed Gradient Backgrounds
The `bg-gradient-to-br from-primary to-primary-dark` classes weren't working because Tailwind v4 doesn't recognize them automatically.

**Added gradient utilities**:
```css
.bg-gradient-to-br {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, var(--tw-gradient-from), var(--tw-gradient-to));
}

.from-primary {
  --tw-gradient-from: #DC2626;
  --tw-gradient-to: rgb(220 38 38 / 0);
}

.to-primary-dark {
  --tw-gradient-to: #B91C1C;
}
```

This fixed the "Ready to Stop Your Foreclosure?" section that was showing white text on white background.

### 4. Logo Updated
Replaced placeholder logo with actual "Stop Foreclosures NJ" logo featuring:
- Red hexagon shield (#DC2626)
- White house icon
- "STOP FORECLOSURES NJ" text

**Files Updated**:
- `/public/images/logo.png` - Main logo (500x500 PNG)
- `/public/images/logo-white.png` - White version for footer

## üöÄ Deployment

**Production URL**: https://sfnj-o1gkd8cih-fixr-ai.vercel.app

**Changes Deployed**:
1. Updated color system for Tailwind v4 compatibility
2. Fixed all contrast issues
3. Replaced logo with actual brand image
4. All 36 pages updated with new styles

---

## üîç How Issues Were Found

Used **Playwright automation** to:
1. Navigate to each page
2. Scan all text elements and buttons
3. Calculate contrast ratios using WCAG formula
4. Identify elements failing WCAG AA standards

**Scan covered**:
- Homepage
- 10 County pages
- 20 City/Township pages
- Locations index page

---

## üìù Recommendations Going Forward

1. **Always test new content** for color contrast before deploying
2. **Use the darker red** (#DC2626) for all CTAs to maintain accessibility
3. **Test on Playwright** regularly to catch contrast issues early
4. **Consider adding** focus indicators for keyboard navigation
5. **Test with screen readers** to ensure full accessibility compliance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

### Tailwind CSS v4 Migration Challenges:
- v4 doesn't auto-load `tailwind.config.js` theme colors
- Gradient utilities must be manually defined
- Hover states require explicit CSS classes
- All custom colors need to be defined in `@layer components`

### Solution:
Created comprehensive utility classes in `app/globals.css` to bridge the gap between Tailwind v3 and v4 syntax.
