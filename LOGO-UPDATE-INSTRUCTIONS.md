# Logo Update Instructions

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Manual Logo Upload Required

The logo image you uploaded needs to be manually saved to replace the placeholder.

### Steps to Update the Logo:

1. **Save the logo image** from the conversation:
   - Right-click on the red hexagon shield logo image in the conversation
   - Select "Save Image As..."
   - Save it to your Desktop or Downloads folder

2. **Replace the placeholder**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project
   cd /Users/mszwed9696/SFNJ

   # Copy your saved logo to the public/images folder
   # Replace PATH_TO_YOUR_LOGO with the actual path
   cp ~/Desktop/logo.png public/images/logo.png
   ```

3. **Verify the logo**:
   ```bash
   file public/images/logo.png
   # Should show: PNG image data, [dimensions], 8-bit/color RGB
   ```

4. **Rebuild and deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   vercel --prod --yes
   ```

## Alternative: Using the Logo URL

If you have the logo hosted somewhere or can access it via URL:

```bash
cd /Users/mszwed9696/SFNJ
curl -o public/images/logo.png "YOUR_LOGO_URL_HERE"
```

## Logo Specifications

The logo should be:
- **Format**: PNG (with transparency) or SVG
- **Dimensions**: Approximately 500x140 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
- **Design**: Red hexagon shield with white house icon and "STOP FORECLOSURES NJ" text
- **File size**: Under 100KB for optimal performance

## For Now

A temporary placeholder logo has been created. The site will work, but you'll want to replace it with your actual logo as soon as possible.

**Temporary logo location**: `/Users/mszwed9696/SFNJ/public/images/logo.png`

Once you've updated the logo, run:

```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod --yes
```
