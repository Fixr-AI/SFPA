### 2. ✅ Color Contrast Issues Fixed

## 🔍 Issues Identified & Resolved

### Before (49 issues found):
1. **Red buttons**: 3.76:1 contrast ratio (failed WCAG AA)
2. **White-on-white text**: Multiple sections with 1.0:1 contrast (completely invisible)
3. **Red numbered circles**: Poor visibility on white backgrounds
4. **Banner text**: "Received a Foreclosure Notice?" not visible
5. **Tailwind v4 colors**: Custom color classes not working

### After (All critical issues resolved):
1. **Red buttons**: 4.53:1 contrast ratio ✅ (passes WCAG AA)
2. **Gradient backgrounds**: Properly displaying red-to-dark-red ✅
3. **Numbered circles**: Visible with proper red backgrounds ✅
4. **Banner text**: Clear and readable on red background ✅
5. **All color utilities**: Working correctly ✅

**Note**: Scanner still reports 8 "issues" with gradient backgrounds, but these are false positives. The JavaScript scanner can't detect CSS gradient backgrounds properly, but visual inspection confirms all text is visible and readable.
