### On the page you're currently viewing:

1. **Look at the top section** "Vercel Authentication"
2. **Click the BLUE toggle** next to "Enabled for: Standard Protection"

## Visual Guide:

**CURRENT STATE (What you see now)**:
```
Vercel Authentication
üîµ Enabled for: [Standard Protection ‚ñº]  üëà THIS IS ON (BAD)
```

**SHOULD BE**:
```
Vercel Authentication
‚ö™ Disabled  üëà THIS SHOULD BE OFF (GOOD)
```

---

## After Disabling:

The site will be **immediately accessible** at:
- https://sfnj-oe6kxokl1-fixr-ai.vercel.app

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Homepage with "Stop Foreclosure in New Jersey"
- ‚úÖ Lead capture form
- ‚úÖ County links
- ‚úÖ Full website working

---

## Alternative: Make it Public via Dropdown

If you want to keep authentication but make it public:

1. Click the **dropdown** next to "Standard Protection"
2. Look for an option like:
   - "Disabled"
   - "Public"
   - "No Authentication"
3. Select that option
4. Click "Save"

---

## Test URLs After Fix:

Once you turn off the toggle and save:

1. **Homepage**: https://sfnj-oe6kxokl1-fixr-ai.vercel.app
2. **Cumberland County**: https://sfnj-oe6kxokl1-fixr-ai.vercel.app/county/cumberland-county
3. **Locations**: https://sfnj-oe6kxokl1-fixr-ai.vercel.app/locations

All should work immediately (no 404, no login required).

## What Vercel Authentication Does:

When ENABLED (as it is now):
- ‚ùå Requires users to log in to Vercel
- ‚ùå Shows "Authentication Required" page
- ‚ùå Blocks all public access
- ‚ùå Makes site inaccessible to customers

When DISABLED:
- ‚úÖ Site is fully public
- ‚úÖ Anyone can visit
- ‚úÖ No login required
- ‚úÖ Customers can access and submit forms

---

## Screenshot Reference:

In your current screenshot, you need to:
1. Click the **blue toggle button** (currently shows as enabled)
2. It will turn gray/white when disabled
3. Click the **"Save" button** (bottom right)
4. Done!

That's it - just **ONE toggle switch** needs to be turned OFF.

---

## Verification:

After clicking the toggle and saving, run this test:

1. Open a **new incognito/private browser window**
2. Go to: https://sfnj-oe6kxokl1-fixr-ai.vercel.app
3. You should see the Stop Foreclosures NJ homepage
4. No login prompt!

The site is built perfectly - it just needs this one security setting changed! üöÄ
